My HTML Resource is W3 schools found at https://www.w3schools.com/html/.
This resource is really valuable because it has easy to understand tutorials for HTML that emphasizes its' usability for complete beginners. I have found it easier to understand than other resources.

My CSS Resource is Geeks for Geeks found at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/.
I enjoy this resource because it allows for feedback and assistance from computer science experts across the country. This is useful when I have a specific question or need assistance with something that I would not find on an article.
